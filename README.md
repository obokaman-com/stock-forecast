# Stock & crypto value prediction app

This is a very simple initial version of the app.

At this moment it only can use some linear algorithms, SquareLevels, Support Vector Regression and a basic linear regression based on Cumulative Moving Averages.

Next steps: 
* apply something more sophisticated as prediction algorithm, being able to make a complete technical analysis of the stock historical values.
* gather information about the stock from Twitter and financial news, to build a sentiment graph around the stock, to affect the predictions.
* apply some ML to find patterns between the stock value evolution and other stocks in the same segment, to affect the predictions.
* ...Â¿?

## Installation

**Install PHP 8.1 and Git in your local machine** *(Example for Mac)*

Install Homebrew (package manager) if you don't have it yet, and install Git + PHP 8.1 + Composer:

```bash
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)`
$ brew install git php composer
```

**Download app and install all dependencies**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/obokaman-com/stock-forecast
$ cd stock-forecast
$ composer install
```

#### API keys

This code uses the CryptoCompare API, for large number of queries you will need to register an API key at http://www.cryptocompare.com and set it in `.env`.

Similarly, you will need to set a Telegram bot key in .env to use the Telegram functionality.


## Examples

#### Forecast  

You can try it with `bin/console forecast:stock <base_currency> <stock/crypto code> <date_interval_magnitude (minutes/hours/days)>`

```bash
$ bin/console forecast:stock USD BTC days
``` 

This will generate a table with the historical price information and a prevision for the next period based in the historical data, giving you three estimations, 
based on short-term, medium-term and long-term.

**Output:**

#### Telegram bot (@CryptoInsightsBot)

You can use this project to run a robo-advisor using Telegram. You'll find some commands and callbacks implemented under `App/Controller/Telegram` 

If you want to test with your own bot, you should add an environment variable called `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, with your assigned token. More information about creating your own Telegram bot on https://core.telegram.org/bots 

An example Telegram bot is running as @CryptoInsightsBot. You can test it at https://t.me/CryptoInsightsBot

It implements two simple commands: 
* `/insights`: allow you to view signals for choosen currency - crypto pair
* `/subscribe`: allow you to receive real-time alerts with relevant signals for choosen currency - crypto pair signal.
